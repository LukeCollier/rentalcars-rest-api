(https://travis-ci.org/LukeCollier/rentalcars-rest-api)

## Part 1 Console Application
To run the console application locate the app.jar and run it using java -jar
file-path/app.jar

## Part 2 API
To run the API simply run the activator in the bin folder. This will open a new
webpage that can be used to build/run/test the API and the application can then
be found on the localhost at http://localhost:9000.

Once the localhost is running there are 4 different routes for each of the tasks
1. http://localhost:9000/car/sort/price - get's the vehicle list in price order
2. http://localhost:9000/car/summary - get's the vehicle list summary
3. http://localhost:9000/car/sort/rating - get's the vehicle list in rating and
vehicle type order
4. http://localhost:9000/car/sort/score - get's the vehicle list by score order
